Disclaimer(!!!):
   
    -   The original code was taken from `https://github.com/shantnu/FaceDetect.git`, which helped me with the face detection stage
    -   None of the xmls belongs to me
    -   I've just took different sources from the internet, edited them a little to detect masks and then went off

Dependencies:
   
    -   python 3.x
    -   OCV3
    -   Camera or images


Example to run mask detection with stale image:

*python face_detect.py <image_path>*

Example to run mask detection with camera:

*python live.py*
